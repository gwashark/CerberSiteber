      <h2>About CerberVT</h2>
      <p>
        Cerber was named after Cerberus, the gatekeeper of Hell, and lives in
        hell under the UK. She was entranced by the world of video games, anime,
        VTubers and idols filled with fun and luster, a stark contrast to the
        dark underworld she was all so familiar with.

        <h3>Character Details ðŸ’œðŸ¦´</h3>
        <div class="info-grid">
      	  {CharacterDetails.map((detail: CharacterDetailsProps) => (
			      <div class="info-item"><strong>{detail.name}:</strong> {detail.value}</div>
		      ))}
        </div>

        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p>
          She is a cheerful beacon of intense positivity and wholesomeness. As a
          hellhound, she nicknames everyone with "Wan" in their name and uses it
          like a verbal tick, such as switching "1" for wan at every
          opportunity. She is easily flustered by simple compliments, adding to
          her endearing nature.
        </p>

        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p>
          Standing at 4'1" (or, as she says it, 4 foot wan), Cerber has blonde
          hair styled in slightly wavy flowing twintails and violet-pink eyes.
          Her distinctive horns, which she insists are real (though fans debate
          whether they're dark chocolate or Styrofoam), are maintained by Hell
          magic to prevent melting in hell's heat. In her hellhound form, she
          transforms into an adorable 1 ft. tall (wan foot tall) puppy.
        </p>

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>

      </div>
      <h3>Her Community: Minawan</h3>
      <p>
        Cerber's loving community is called Minawan, a clever wordplay on
        "mina-san" (meaning "everyone" in Japanese). The Minawan mascot looks
        similar to Cerber's dog form but lacks the demon tail and horns,
        appearing as a friendly, adorable dog.
